<div>
<p>Each Singaporean household can claim $300 in CDC Vouchers digitally at <a href="https://go.gov.sg/cdcv">go.gov.sg/cdcv</a>.</p>
<p>The CDC Vouchers Scheme 2026 (January) was announced by Prime Minister Mr Lawrence Wong during Budget 2025. It aims to provide additional support for Singaporean households to tackle cost pressures.</p>
<p>The value of the $300 CDC Vouchers 2026 (January) will be allocated equally (i.e. $150 each) to be spent at participating heartland merchants and hawkers, and at participating supermarkets. Singaporean households have until 31 December 2026 to claim and spend their CDC Vouchers 2026 (January).</p>

<label for="accordion4"><span style="font-weight: 700; font-size: 20px; font-style: normal; color:#000080">Why are the CDC vouchers in fixed denominations? / Can we choose or key in the exact amount of vouchers we want to use (for example, $1.50)?</span></label>
<div>
<p>The vouchers are in fixed denominations because it is less confusing for residents, especially the digitally less-savvy, and reduces the chance for errors to occur when residents key in the amount.</p>
<p>The CDCs and Govtech had several rounds of consultations with residents and merchants to gather feedback on the design of the denominations.</p><p>For the CDC Vouchers to be used at heartland merchants and hawkers, the fixed denominations of $2, $5 and $10 allow residents to make purchases at different heartland shops and hawkers. For example, residents may patronise mini-marts or mom-and-pop shops, to purchase groceries or other essential household items, and services such as dental clinics, or hair salons.</p>
<p>For the CDC Vouchers to be used at supermarkets, the larger denominations of $10 will come in handy as the purchase amounts are typically larger due to the nature of goods sold at supermarkets.</p>

<label for="accordion5"><span style="font-weight: 700; font-size: 20px; font-style: normal; color:#000080">Can the vouchers be shared with my household members?</span></label>
<div>
<p>The vouchers can be shared with your household members via the following method.</p>
<p>1. Click on “Share” button to copy the unique voucher link<br> 2. Paste into any preferred messaging apps e.g. SMS/ Whatsapp/ Telegram. Please refer to diagram below for illustration.</p>
<p>Recipients are advised to be careful with sharing unique voucher links with others, as this would allow others to spend the household’s vouchers. To ensure that you safekeep your unique voucher links, we urge you to share only when necessary and to the right parties. We seek your understanding that there will be no reinstatement made for vouchers that were shared erroneously.</p>

<label for="accordion6"><span style="font-weight: 700; font-size: 20px; font-style: normal; color:#000080">On some other e-payment platforms, the customers scan the merchant's QR code to make payment. For the CDC Vouchers Scheme, why must merchants scan the customer's voucher QR code instead? </span></label>
<div>
<p>CDCs in partnership with Open Government Products, GovTech, had previously tested the model in which the customer scans the merchant’s QR code. While this is technically possible, we identified it would come with the following drawbacks:</p>
<p>a) If customers were to scan merchants’ QR, all citizens will need to download a mobile app.</p>
<p>b) Digitally less-savvy residents would be excluded from the scheme if they do not download an app or have an e-wallet, unless we specially cater for paper vouchers on top of the e-wallet.</p>
<p>c) We have also found through previous trials with residents that selecting the exact amount to be spent (as in an e-wallet model) was confusing for some residents and error prone.</p>
<p>To ensure that the digital system caters to both digitally savvy and less-savvy residents, we have designed the digital solution such that merchants and residents will have the same workflow regardless of whether digital or paper voucher is used -- i.e., residents will present the digital/ paper voucher, and merchants will scan digital/paper vouchers.</p>

<div>
<p>From 1 July 2024, the Singapore government has launched a new security measure - gov.sg, a single SMS Sender ID to be used across government agencies. This whole-of-government effort to transition to a single SMS Sender ID will make it easier for the public to verify authentic government communications, with greater confidence and accuracy. Moving forward, the public can expect SMSes from government agencies to come from the gov.sg SMS Sender ID, and not from individual government agencies' Sender IDs. PA/CDC aligns with this national effort to help residents access and respond to legitimate communications from the government, such as the CDC Vouchers Scheme.</p>
