    <div>
      <p>In Budget 2021, Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Heng Swee Keat announced the CDC Vouchers Scheme to thank Singaporeans for their sense of solidarity and to support local businesses at HDB estates/heartland enterprises and hawkers. Each Singaporean household will receive $100 CDC Vouchers and the scheme will benefit up to 1.3 million Singaporean households.

    <div>
      <p>All Singaporean households are eligible for the scheme. Each household can claim $100 in CDC vouchers that can be spent at participating heartland merchants and hawkers.

    <label for="accordion4"><span style="font-weight: 700; font-size: 20px; font-style: normal; color:#DB3B18">Why are the CDC vouchers in fixed denominations for this current Tranche?</span></label>
    <div>
			<p>The vouchers are in fixed denominations to enable merchants to process transactions faster and provide the ease of reconciliation for merchants. It also reduces the chance for errors to occur when consumers key in the amount.
			</p> 
			<p>After consultations with merchants, we have determined that the $2, $5 and $10 were the 3 best preferred denominations to cater to a range of purchases – for example, to cover purchases of both drinks and food at the hawkers and other items/ services at heartland shops (e.g. groceries, haircuts).

    <div>
 			<p>Yes, you can share the vouchers with your household members by clicking on the “Share voucher” button and paste the link into Whatsapp and other communication channels. 
			</p>
			
<p>Do note that sharing your voucher link constitutes providing them with access to your voucher.
