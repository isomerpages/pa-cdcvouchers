<div>
<p>Each Singaporean household can claim $300 in CDC Vouchers digitally at <a href="https://go.gov.sg/cdcv">go.gov.sg/cdcv</a>.</p>
<p>The CDC Vouchers Scheme 2026 (January) was announced by Prime Minister Mr Lawrence Wong during Budget 2025. It aims to provide additional support for Singaporean households to tackle cost pressures.</p>
<p>The value of the $300 CDC Vouchers 2026 (January) will be allocated equally (i.e. $150 each) to be spent at participating heartland merchants and hawkers, and at participating supermarkets. Singaporean households have until 31 December 2026 to claim and spend their CDC Vouchers 2026 (January).</p>

<input type="checkbox" id="accordion10">
<label for="accordion10"><span style="font-weight: 700; font-size: 20px; font-style: normal; color:#000080">What should the Sender ID of the CDC Vouchers link be? Is it gov.sg or RedeemSG?</span></label>
<div>
<p>From 1 July 2024, the Singapore government has launched a new security measure - gov.sg, a single SMS Sender ID to be used across government agencies. This whole-of-government effort to transition to a single SMS Sender ID will make it easier for the public to verify authentic government communications, with greater confidence and accuracy. Moving forward, the public can expect SMSes from government agencies to come from the gov.sg SMS Sender ID, and not from individual government agencies' Sender IDs. PA/CDC aligns with this national effort to help residents access and respond to legitimate communications from the government, such as the CDC Vouchers Scheme.</p>

<div>
<p>When you sign up for your vouchers, a One Time Password (OTP) will be sent to the mobile number you have keyed in for verification, to ensure vouchers will not be sent to the wrong mobile number.  If you had keyed in the wrong mobile number, you will not receive the One Time Password and you can return to the previous page to key in your mobile number again.</p>

<div>
<p>The SMS is identifiable by the sender named “Gov.sg”. The voucher link should also start with the prefix https://voucher.redeem.gov.sg.  Do not trust voucher links starting with other prefixes.</p>
<p>Please be careful to only use the official links and QR code (<a href="https://go.gov.sg/cdcv">go.gov.sg/cdcv</a>) to claim your vouchers. Gov.sg will only send you an SMS with your unique voucher link after you claim your vouchers at go.gov.sg/cdcv and will never send SMSes requiring your personal or banking details.</p>
<p>If you detect any suspicious messages relating to RedeemSG or Gov.sg or CDC vouchers, please contact PA at 6225 5322, or submit the information online at <a href="https://www.police.gov.sg/iwitness">www.police.gov.sg/iwitness</a> or call 1800 2555 0000 to make a police report.</p>

<div>
<p>After multiple tranches of CDC Vouchers Scheme, residents are familiar with the claim and spend process of CDC Vouchers, making hardcopy notification letter as reminder less necessary. As such, as part of CDCs’ commitment towards environmental sustainability, it was decided not to issue any hardcopy letters since CDC Vouchers 2025 (May).  Information on CDC Vouchers will be announced through official channels (such as the CDC Vouchers Scheme website, HDB Digital Display Panels, noticeboards at CCs) and media outlets. For assistance, residents can approach any of their Community Centres/Clubs during their opening hours.</p>

<div>
<p>There is no need for residents to download any mobile application. Simply claim your vouchers at go.gov.sg/cdcv. The voucher link will be sent to your verified mobile number. You can then use the vouchers by presenting the QR code at participating hawkers, heartland merchants, and supermarkets.</p>

<p>Merchants will receive a transaction successful confirmation on either their RedeemSG Merchant mobile application or Point-of-Sales interface. At the same time, your QR code will be updated to “Redeemed” along with the merchant’s name and time of transaction. If you have exited that page, you can view your transaction history on the main vouchers page instead. All spent vouchers will no longer be clickable and will be marked as redeemed.</p>
