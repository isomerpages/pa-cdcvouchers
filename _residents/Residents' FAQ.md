    <label for="accordion1"><span style="font-weight: 700; font-size: 20px; font-style: normal; color:#DB3B18">What is the CDC Vouchers Scheme?</span></label>
    <div>
      <p>In Budget 2021, Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Heng Swee Keat announced the CDC Vouchers Scheme to thank Singaporeans for their sense of solidarity and to support local businesses at HDB estates/heartland enterprises and hawkers. Each Singaporean household will receive $100 CDC Vouchers and the scheme will benefit up to 1.3 million Singaporean households.

    <label for="accordion2"><span style="font-weight: 700; font-size: 20px; font-style: normal; color:#DB3B18">Who is eligible for the CDC Vouchers Scheme?</span></label>
    <div>
      <p>All Singaporean households are eligible for the scheme. Each Singaporean household can claim $100 in CDC vouchers that can be spent at participating heartland merchants and hawkers.

    <label for="accordion3"><span style="font-weight: 700; font-size: 20px; font-style: normal; color:#DB3B18">How do I/my household apply for the CDC Vouchers Scheme?</span></label>
    <div>
      <p>
				There is no need to apply for the scheme.  All Singaporean households will receive a notification letter on how to claim their CDC vouchers at <a href="https://go.gov.sg/cdcv"><strong>go.gov.sg/cdcv</strong></a>

    <label for="accordion4"><span style="font-weight: 700; font-size: 20px; font-style: normal; color:#DB3B18">Why are the CDC vouchers in fixed denominations for this current Tranche?</span></label>
    <div>
			<p>The vouchers are in fixed denominations because it is less confusing for residents, especially the digitally less savvy, and reduces the chance for errors to occur when residents key in the amount.  It enables merchants to receive their reimbursement faster. </p>
<p>
Taking in the feedback from the merchants who participated in the trials and previous CDC Vouchers Scheme, the vouchers are therefore in denominations of $2, $5 and $10.

    <label for="accordion5"><span style="font-weight: 700; font-size: 20px; font-style: normal; color:#DB3B18">Can the vouchers be shared with my household members?</span></label>
    <div>
 			<p>Yes, the vouchers can be shared with your household members via the following method. 
			</p>
			
<p>Click on “Share My Vouchers” button to copy the unique voucher link and paste into any preferred messaging apps e.g. SMS/ Whatsapp/ Telegram. Please refer to diagram below for illustration. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Do note that sharing your voucher link constitutes providing them with access to your voucher. Anyone with the voucher link can use your vouchers.

    <label for="accordion6"><span style="font-weight: 700; font-size: 20px; font-style: normal; color:#DB3B18">	   Customers are required to scan the merchant’s QR Code to make payment on some of the other e-payment platforms.  Why are merchants required to scan the customer’s voucher QR code for the CDC Vouchers Scheme instead? </span></label>
    <div>
 			<p>CDCs in partnership with Open Government Products, GovTech, had previously tested the model in which the customer scans the merchant’s QR. While this is technically possible, we identified it would come with the following drawbacks:</p>
<p>
	a) If customers were to scan merchants’ QR, all citizens will need to download a mobile app. </p>
			<p>
b) Digitally less savvy residents would be excluded from the scheme if they do not download an app or have an e-wallet, unless we specially cater for paper vouchers on top of the e-wallet.</p>
			<p>
c) We have also found through previous trials with residents and found that selecting the exact amount to be spent (as in an e-wallet model) was confusing for some residents and error prone.
			</p>
			<p>
To ensure that the digital system caters to both digitally savvy and less digitally savvy residents, we have designed the digital solution such that merchants and residents will have the same workflow regardless of whether digital or paper is used -- residents will present the digital/ paper voucher, and merchants will scan digital/paper vouchers.

 			<p>The CDC Voucher Scheme will be valid from 13 December 2021 to 31 December 2022. Vouchers can be claimed or spent at participating heartland merchants and hawkers anytime within this period.</p>

    <div>
			<p>There is no need for residents to download any mobile application. Simply claim your vouchers by going to <a href>go.gov.sg/cdcv</a>.

    <div>
			<p>When the merchants scan your QR code, they will see a confirmation on their RedeemSG Merchant app which will show that the scanning of your voucher is a success.  At the same time, your QR code will be updated to “Redeemed” status.  Spent vouchers will also be marked as ‘Redeemed’ on your unique voucher links.

			<p>The QR codes are similar to cash and any misplaced printed QR codes may be used by anyone who picked it.</p> 
			<p>You may request for a re-print at the CCs if the vouchers have been partially used, but a new set of vouchers will not be issued again.</p> 
			<p>Recipients are advised to exercise personal responsibility in safekeeping their vouchers as they are equivalent to cash. Recipients are advised to be careful with sharing their voucher links, as this provides access to be able to spend the voucher at participating merchants.
