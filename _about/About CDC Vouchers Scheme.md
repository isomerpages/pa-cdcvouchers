The CDC Vouchers Scheme is launched on 13 December 2021 by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong. The new CDC Vouchers Scheme, which was announced at Budget 2021, provides for $130 million CDC vouchers to be distributed to all Singaporean households for use at participating hawkers and heartland merchants.

The Scheme has two key objectives: 
1. To thank Singaporeans for their sense of solidarity during the pandemic
2. To inject life back into hawkers and heartland merchants that have been hit hard by the Covid-19 pandemic.
