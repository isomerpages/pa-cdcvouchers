The $130 million CDC Vouchers Scheme was launched by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, Chairman of People's Association: 

1. To thank Singaporeans for their sense of solidarity during the COVID-19 pandemic
2. To support hawkers and heartland merchants affected by the pandemic 

The next tranche of the CDC Vouchers Scheme announced by Finance Minister Mr Lawrence Wong during Budget 2022 will be part of the Household Support Package to support Singaporean households in their daily expenses.  The CDCs will launch another set of CDC Vouchers for 2022 in the next few months. Residents may use the vouchers until the end of the year, at participating heartland merchants and hawkers. 

Under the Assurance Package, two more tranches will be planned for launch in 2023 and 2024.   More details will be provided when ready.
