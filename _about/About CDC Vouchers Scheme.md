In Budget 2021, Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Heng Swee Keat announced the CDC Vouchers Scheme to thank Singaporeans for their sense of solidarity and to support local businesses at HDB estates/heartland enterprises and hawkers.  

Each household will receive $100 CDC Vouchers and will benefit up to 1.3 million Singaporean households. The CDC vouchers will be in a digital format to support the Smart Nation initiative.

Participating merchants such as hawkers and shopkeepers will use the RedeemSG Merchant app to scan the QR code on the vouchers to be reimbursed.

Ambassadors from the CDCs and the SG Digital Office will help merchants learn to use the RedeemSG Merchant app.
