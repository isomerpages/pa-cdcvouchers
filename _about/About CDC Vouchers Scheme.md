The $130 million CDC Vouchers Scheme was launched by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, Chairman of People's Association: 

1. To thank Singaporeans for their sense of solidarity during the COVID-19 pandemic
2. To support hawkers and heartland merchants affected by the pandemic 

The Finance Minister Mr Lawrence Wong recently announced at Budget 2022 that the Community Development Councils (CDCs) will be given three new tranches of the CDC Voucher Scheme from 2022 to 2024 to support Singaporeans during difficult times. This is in addition to the $100 in CDC vouchers that every Singaporean household is eligible for, announced in Budget 2021.

In May 2022, the CDCs will distribute $100 worth of CDC Vouchers
2022 to each Singaporean Household to help in daily expenses as part of the Household Support Package.
