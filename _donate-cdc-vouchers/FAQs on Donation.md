    <div>
			<p><strong>CDC Vouchers Scheme 2022</strong></p>
		      <p>The Finance Minister Mr Lawrence Wong announced at Budget 2022 that as part of the Household Support Package, the Community Development Councils (CDCs) will be given three new tranches of the CDC Vouchers Scheme from 2022 to 2024 to support Singaporeans during difficult times. This is in addition to the $100 in CDC vouchers that every Singaporean household is eligible for, announced in Budget 2021.</p>
			<p>
In May 2022, all Singaporean households can each receive $100 in CDC vouchers to help in daily expenses as part of the Household Support Package. You can use the vouchers to purchase goods and services from participating hawkers and heartland merchants.</p>
			<p><strong>CDC Vouchers Scheme 2021</strong></p>
			<p>
						Deputy Prime Minister and then Finance Minister Mr Heng Swee Keat launched the CDC Vouchers Scheme in June 2020 and January 2021 respectively to help Singaporean lower-income households defray their cost of living and at the same time, to support hawkers and heartland merchants affected by Covid-19 pandemic.  Each identified Singaporean lower-income household received $50 worth of CDC Vouchers in June 2020 and January 2021. </p>
			<p>
In Budget 2021, Deputy Prime Minister and then Minister for Finance, Mr Heng Swee Keat announced the $130million CDC Vouchers Scheme to thank Singaporeans for their sense of solidarity and to support heartland merchants and hawkers.  Each Singaporean household will receive $100 CDC vouchers and the scheme will benefit up to 1.3 million Singaporean households. </p>

    <div>
      <p>
				All Singaporean households are automatically eligible for the scheme, and will receive a notification letter on how to claim their CDC Vouchers at <a href="https://go.gov.sg/cdcv" target="redeemsg"><strong>go.gov.sg/cdcv</strong></a>.</p>
			<p> Any one member of the household in the notification letter can scan the QR code in the letter to claim the vouchers.

    <label for="accordion4"><span style="font-weight: 700; font-size: 20px; font-style: normal; color:#000080">Why are the CDC vouchers in fixed denominations?</span></label>
    <div>
			<p>The vouchers are in fixed denominations because it is less confusing for residents, especially the digitally less-savvy, and reduces the chance for errors to occur when residents key in the amount.  It enables merchants to receive their reimbursement faster.</p>
<p>
The CDCs and Govtech had several rounds of consultations with residents and merchants to gather feedback on the design of the denominations. The fixed denominations of $2, $5 and $10 allow residents to make purchases at different heartland shops and hawkers. For example, residents may patronise mini-marts or mom-and-pop shops, to purchase groceries or other essential household items, and services such as dental clinics, or hair salons. The larger denominations ($5 and $10) will come in handy at these shops, and residents can also use them to have meals with family members or friends.	</p>

    <label for="accordion5"><span style="font-weight: 700; font-size: 20px; font-style: normal; color:#000080">Can the vouchers be shared with my household members?</span></label>
    <div>
 			<p>Yes, the vouchers can be shared with your household members via the following method. 
			</p>
			
<p>Click on “Share” button to copy the unique voucher link and paste into any preferred messaging apps e.g. SMS/ Whatsapp/ Telegram. Please refer to diagram below for illustration. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Recipients are advised to be careful with sharing unique voucher links with others, as this would allow them to spend the household’s vouchers. To ensure that you safekeep your unique voucher links, we urge you to share only when necessary and to the right parties. We seek your understanding that there will be no reinstatement made for vouchers that were shared erroneously.

    <label for="accordion6"><span style="font-weight: 700; font-size: 20px; font-style: normal; color:#000080">Customers are required to scan the merchant’s QR Code to make payment on some of the other e-payment platforms.  Why are merchants required to scan the customer’s voucher QR code for the CDC Vouchers Scheme instead? </span></label>
    <div>
 			<p>CDCs in partnership with Open Government Products, GovTech, had previously tested the model in which the customer scans the merchant’s QR. While this is technically possible, we identified it would come with the following drawbacks:</p>
<p>
	a) If customers were to scan merchants’ QR, all citizens will need to download a mobile app. </p>
			<p>
b) Digitally less-savvy residents would be excluded from the scheme if they do not download an app or have an e-wallet, unless we specially cater for paper vouchers on top of the e-wallet.</p>
			<p>
c) We have also found through previous trials with residents that selecting the exact amount to be spent (as in an e-wallet model) was confusing for some residents and error prone.
			</p>
			<p>
To ensure that the digital system caters to both digitally savvy and digitally less-savvy residents, we have designed the digital solution such that merchants and residents will have the same workflow regardless of whether digital or paper is used -- residents will present the digital/ paper voucher, and merchants will scan digital/paper vouchers.

 			<p>The CDC Vouchers Scheme 2021 and 2022 will be valid until 31 December 2022. Vouchers can be claimed or spent at participating heartland merchants and hawkers anytime within this period. More details on the upcoming tranches will be announced in due course.</p>
