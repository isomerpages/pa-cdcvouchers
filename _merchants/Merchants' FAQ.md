    <div>
      <p>In Budget 2021, Deputy Prime  Minister, Mr Heng Swee Keat announced a $150 million CDC Voucher Scheme to thank Singaporeans for their solidarity and to support local businesses at HDB estates/heartland enterprises and hawkers. Each household will receive $100 CDC Vouchers and will benefit up to 1.3 million Singaporean households.</p>

<p>The CDC Vouchers will be in a digital format to support the Smart Nation initiative.</p>
