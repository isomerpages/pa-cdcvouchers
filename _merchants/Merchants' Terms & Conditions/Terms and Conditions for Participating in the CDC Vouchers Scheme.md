<p><em>As of Sept 2024</em>
</p>
<p><strong>TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR PARTICIPATING IN THE COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT COUNCIL VOUCHERS SCHEME (the “Scheme”)</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>By participating in the Scheme (including such further tranches of this
Scheme as may be announced by the government from time to time) you agree
and accept to be legally bound by the Terms and Conditions set out below,
and any changes that may be made from time to time.&nbsp; You will be notified
accordingly if there are any changes to these Terms and Conditions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The CDC
Vouchers decal (which is included in the welcome kit) must be prominently
displayed at your store front immediately upon receipt of the welcome kit
for the entire duration of your participation in the Scheme. Your store
displaying the CDC Vouchers decal will be referred to as “Premises” in
these Terms and Conditions.</p>
<p>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon display
of the CDC Vouchers decal, you agree to accept all vouchers presented by
voucher holders (i.e. residents), and must not restrict or limit the days
or hours in which CDC Vouchers are accepted at your Premises.</p>
<p>&nbsp;3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Scheme
is in a digital format where vouchers in the form of QR codes will be presented
by voucher holders (i.e. residents) to you for redemption. Before accepting
a digital voucher for redemption, you must use your best endeavours to
ensure that all voucher redemptions comply with the following terms and
conditions:</p>
<p>&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; vouchers cannot be used for purchase of lottery
products, petrol, diesel, alcohol or cigarettes;</p>
<p>&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp; vouchers are not exchangeable for cash or gift vouchers
and are not for resale;</p>
<p>&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; multiple vouchers may be used in a single
transaction;</p>
<p>&nbsp;(d)&nbsp;&nbsp; any unused amount/value in a voucher is not refundable;
and</p>
<p>&nbsp;(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; once the voucher expires, it cannot be renewed.
The expiry date cannot be changed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some voucher
holders (i.e. residents) may present hardcopy printouts of the digital
vouchers for redemption.&nbsp; In such cases, you will use your best endeavours
to ensure that no expired, defaced, damaged, stolen, duplicate or counterfeit
voucher printouts are accepted for redemption.</p>
<p>&nbsp;5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Redemptions
of vouchers will be done through the RedeemSG Merchant application. Your
use of the RedeemSG Merchant application is subject to and governed by
a separate set of terms and conditions which can be found on the RedeemSG
Merchant application and at <a href="https://redeem.gov.sg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">https://redeem.gov.sg</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;
You will receive reimbursements for redeemed vouchers via PayNow (or such
other similar online banking mode) 1 day after the redemption is recorded
in the RedeemSG application.</p>
<p>&nbsp;6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If any redeemed
voucher is found to be misused, stolen, forged, damaged, defaced or otherwise
tampered with, People’s Association (“PA”) reserves the right not to make
any payment or recover from you (as the case may be) the payment made in
respect of the voucher(s) in question.</p>
<p>&nbsp;7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If any participating
merchant/hawker is found to have misused, forged, damaged, defaced or otherwise
tampered with any voucher or voucher printout, the participating merchant/hawker
shall be liable to pay PA (through the CDCs) the value of such voucher(s)
and such other loss suffered by PA as a result of the participating merchant/hawker’s
actions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Any misuse/tampering/forgery
of vouchers may constitute a criminal offence and the offender will be
liable for prosecution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All data
including business contact information (as defined in the Personal Data
Protection Act 2012) and personal data (if any) collected will be used
and disclosed to other government agencies (such as Govtech) for the purposes
of administering the Scheme. While we only require your business contact
information (such as the bank account details, contact information and
UEN used by your business), we may accept your personal information (such
as your NRIC No.), should you choose to provide such information to us
in lieu of your business contact information.</p>
<p>10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a merchant/hawker participating
in the Scheme you agree that you will not, and will ensure that your employees
do not, carry out any activity at your Premises which is illegal, immoral,
discriminatory, offensive or which may otherwise bring the Scheme and/or
PA into disrepute. PA reserves the right to take such immediate action
as it deems fit in such an event.</p>
<p>11&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Participating merchants/hawkers
are responsible for resolving any issues or disputes that may arise between
them and a voucher holder (i.e. resident). PA (as the voucher issuer) will
not be responsible for resolving such issues or disputes, or for any claims,
demands, losses, costs, expenses and/or liabilities of any kind whatsoever,
arising from or in connection with any transaction or dealing between participating
merchant/hawker and the voucher holder.</p>
<p>12&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PA reserves the right to
terminate Your participation in the Scheme at any time without prior written
notice. PA shall not be liable to you for any damages or compensation as
a result of such termination. PA shall also not be required to give any
reason for such termination. Your participation in the Scheme shall cease
on the date stated in the written notice and you must remove the CDC Vouchers
decal from your Premise on the same date.</p>
<p>&nbsp;13&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These Terms and Conditions
shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of Singapore.</p>
