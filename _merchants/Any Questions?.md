Recommendations on this will be released at a future date.<br><br>
*Sinovac-CoronaVac should not be used as a booster vaccination. The exception is for persons who have been recommended to receive a booster but are unable to receive an mRNA vaccine due to medical reasons, such as an allergy to the mRNA vaccine.

    					<p>	If you have recovered from a COVID-19 infection, it is recommended that you receive a single dose of an mRNA vaccine at least 3 months after the date of your diagnosis, if you have not already completed your vaccination. There is evidence that a single dose of mRNA would further boost your immunity against COVID-19.<br><br>
If you are medically ineligible to receive the mRNA vaccine, you may take two doses of Sinovac-CoronaVac vaccine spaced 28 days apart, from 3 months after the date of your diagnosis.<br><br>
No additional booster dose is recommended at this time.

    					<p>You are recommended to receive three doses of the Sinovac-CoronaVac COVID-19 vaccine to achieve vaccine protection and be considered fully vaccinated. The third dose should be received from 90 days after the second dose.<br><br>
Persons who had received two doses of Sinovac-CoronaVac/Sinopharm are recommended to receive a dose of the PSAR mRNA vaccine to complete their primary vaccination series if they are not contraindicated to receive the mRNA vaccines.<br><br>
To provide enough time for you to get your third dose and maintain your vaccination status, all individuals who have taken two doses of Sinovac-CoronaVac will be regarded as fully vaccinated for 4 months after the second dose, or until 31 December 2021, whichever is later.
